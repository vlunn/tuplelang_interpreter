**Notes:**
- Edits to the syntax tree since phase 3:
  
  - Removed recursion from:
  
    1. program statement
    2. function call arguments
    3. function and variable definitions
    4. variable definitions in a function body
    5. formal parameters in function definition
    
- Fixed phase 2 problems:

  - String literal catenation problem
  - Error from lexer instead of Python interpreter when return statement missing.
