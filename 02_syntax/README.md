**TODO:**
- Improve error messages in the lexer, try http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ply.html#ply_nn10

**1. What is syntax analysis and how is it related to other parts in compilation? **
    
    TODO
    

**2. How is the syntactic structure of the language expressed in the PLY tool? I.e., what parts are needed in the code and how are they related to syntactic rules of the language?**
    
    TODO
    
**3. Explain in English what the syntax of the following elements mean (i.e. how would you describe the syntax in textual form):**

    1. Variable definitions
        - TODO 
        
    2. Function call
        - TODO 
        
    3. Tuple expressions
        - TODO 
        
**4. Answer the following based on the syntax definition:**

    a. Is it possible to define a "nested" function, i.e. to define a new function inside another function? Why?
        - TODO
        
    b. Is it syntactically possible to perform arithmetic with strings ("Hello"+"world")? Why?
        - TODO
        
    c. Is it possible to initialize a variable from a constant (N<-1. var<-N.)? Why?
        - TODO
        
    d. Is it possible to initialize a constant from a variable (var<-1. N<-var.)? Why?
        - TODO
        
    e. Are the following allowed by the syntax: xx--yy and --xx? Why?
        - TODO
        
    f. How is it ensured that addition/subtraction are done after multiplication/division?
        - TODO
        
**5. Please mention in the document if you didn't implement functions (i.e. you are ok with passing with the minimum grade).**


**6. What did you think of this assignment? What was difficult? What was easy? Did you learn anything useful?**
